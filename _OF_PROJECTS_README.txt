this is the master branch of openframeworks.

We are moving to autogenerated projects, the project files will be disappearing from the repository.

To generate them:


Linux:
    execute scripts/linux/generateProjects.py
    without parameters it will generate all the examples and addonsExamples
    the new cbp files depend on Makefiles, if you want old style makefiles execute the script with -n
    the script can also be used to generate new project passing the path as a parameter in the command line

OS X: 
	build and run the _DeployExamples located at: apps/devApps/_DeployExamples/deployExamples.xcodeproj
	

iPhone: 
	is still to be automated but will also use the OS X _DeployExamples app 

Windows:
	is still to be automated for windows codeblocks
