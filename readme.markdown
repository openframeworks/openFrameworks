this is the master branch of openframeworks.

We are moving to autogenerated projects, the project files will be dissapearing from the repository.

To generate them:


Linux:
    execute scripts/linux/generateProjects.py
    without paramters it will generate all the examples and addonExamples
    the new cbp files depend on Makefiles, if you want old style makefiles execute the script with -n
    the script can also be used to generate new project passing the path as a parameter in the command line
