# welcome

welcome to openframeworks!  Thanks for downloading OF.


## how to get started

The first thing you need to get started with OF is to make sure your IDE is setup.  There are instructions per platform on the download page.  OF doesn't come with it's own IDE and is designed to work on a wide variety of platforms and tools. 

## folder structure: 

This release of OF comes with several folders: 

* addons
* apps
* docs
* examples
* export (on some systems)
* libs
* other
* scripts
* project generator


`docs` has some documentation around OF usage, per platform things to consider, etc.  `apps` and `examples` are where example projects go.  Examples contains a variety of projects that show you how to use OF, and apps is where your own projects will go.  `libs` contains the libraries that OF uses, including the openframeworks core itself.  `addons` are for additional functionality that's not part of the core.  `export` is for DLLs and dylibs that need to be put in each compiled project.  `scripts` have the templates and small scripts for automating OF per platform. `project generator` is a GUI based tool for making new projects. 

## get involved

Also, this is free software, and we learn so much about what is hard, what doesn't make sense, what is useful, etc. The most basic questions are acceptable here!
