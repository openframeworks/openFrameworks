# Ways to Contribute

## Issues

  Feedback is important for us to know what needs the most improvement in OF. Any issues you have with documentation should be posted on http://github.com/openFrameworks/ofSite/issues . Any bugs with the code should be posted http://github.com/openFrameworks/openFrameworks/issues , and if possible, submit a link to the smallest bit of code that demonstrates the exact problem.

## Documentation

  If the documentation is confusing, missing, or just plain wrong and you have a better way to write it, feel free to fork http://github.com/openFrameworks/ofSite , make changes, and submit a pull request. A pull request is a great starting point for a discussion of the proposed improvements.

## Code

  If you found a bug, its a good idea to first submit it as an issue (or find the issue that already exists). That way people can help point out ways to fix it. If you fix the issue, just submit a pull request

For documentation and code improvements, be sure to read and use our [git workflow](git_workflow.md) to make sure your patches get accepted as smoothly as possible.
