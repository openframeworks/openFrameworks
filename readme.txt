this is the master branch of openframeworks.

We are moving to autogenerated projects, the project files will be disappearing from the repository.

To generate them:


Linux:
    install lxml:
    sudo apt-get install python-lxml
    execute scripts/linux/createProjects.py
    without parameters it will generate all the examples and addonsExamples
    the new cbp files depend on Makefiles, if you want old style makefiles execute the script with -n
    the script can also be used to generate new project passing the path as a parameter in the command line

OS X: 
	build and run the _DeployExamples located at: apps/devApps/_DeployExamples/deployExamples.xcodeproj
	

iPhone: 
	is still to be automated but will also use the OS X _DeployExamples app 

Windows Codeblocks:
	install python from http://python.org
	install setup tools from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files
	add python to you path: 
		start > right click on My PC > properties > Advanced > Environment Variables
		edit the Path variable and at the end add:
		;c:\Python27;c:\Python27\Scripts
	open a console: start > Run... > cmd   and execute
		easy_install lxml
	execute scripts/win_cb/createProjects.py
