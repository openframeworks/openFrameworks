### Learning Objectives

This example is the simplest possible openFrameworks app! It does nothing. 

...Well, *almost* nothing. Although it may not be apparent, the emptyExample activates all of the default system states. (For example, it sets the default fill color to white; it just doesn't happen to draw anything with it.)

The emptyExample is great for making sure that your openFrameworks development environment is compiling properly. It can also be useful as a "starter template" for making simple programs. 

The emptyExample will help you understand what are the bare necessities of an openFrameworks program. In this regard, you can think of it as a "Hello World" for OF.
