### Learning Objectives

This openFrameworks example demonstrates how to load audio files, play sounds interactively and how to manipulate their pan and playback speed.

Studying this example will help you understand:

* how to use ``ofSoundPlayer`` to play sounds, and how to use its helpful functions, e.g.:
  * ``load()`` to load a sound file.
  * ``play()`` to play a sound file.
  * ``setSpeed()``, ``setPan()``, ``setVolume()`` do what you would expect them to.
  * ``setMultiPlay()`` to play the sound file more than once at the same time (if set to true).
* how ``ofSoundUpdate()`` is called in ``update()`` to  update the sound playing system.
* how to use ``ofMap()`` to map values to a different range.
* how to allow the user to interact with the app in ``mouseDragged()`` and ``mousePressed()``.


### Expected Behavior

You should see the window separated into three sections: synth, beats, and vocals. Clicking on each section should play a sound file â€“ depending on your mouse position it will play the sounds at varying speeds and pitches.

Instructions for use:

* Click in the left area to play the synth sound file. The x-position of where you clicked should change the pan, the y-position changes the speed.
* Click in the center area to play the beats. Click and drag up and down to change the playback speed.
* Click in the right area to play the vocals. These are set to multiplay, so you can play them at varying speeds several times at once.
