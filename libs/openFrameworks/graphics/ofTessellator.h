/// \brief
/// ofTessellator exists for one purpose: to turn ofPolylines into ofMeshes so
/// that they can be more efficiently displayed using OpenGL. The ofPath class
/// uses tessellation to turn its paths into openGL-ready shapes under the hood,
/// so if you're interested in just having ofPolyline instances converted to
/// meshes, it's handled for you by ofPath. If you're interested in using the
/// tessellation multiple polylines at a time, then you'll find what you need in
/// the ofTessellator. Many shapes can't be drawn by OpenGL without tessellation,
/// but by breaking them into triangles or quads, they can be drawn easily.
/// 
/// An example: The fairly simple shape shown on the left needs to be broken
/// into triangles to be displayed, an example of how this might be done is
/// shown on the right.
