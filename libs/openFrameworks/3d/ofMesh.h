/// \brief Represents a set of vertices in 3D spaces with normals, colors,
/// and texture coordinates at those points.
///
/// Each of these different properties is stored in a vector.
/// Vertices are passed to your graphics card and your graphics card fill in
/// the spaces in between them in a processing usually called the rendering
/// pipeline. The rendering pipeline goes more or less like this:
///
/// 1. Say how you're going to connect all the points.
/// 2. Make some points.
/// 3. Say that you're done making points.
///
/// You may be thinking: I'll just make eight vertices and voila: a cube.
/// Not so quick. There's a hitch and that hitch is that the OpenGL renderer
/// has different ways of connecting the vertices that you pass to it and none
/// are as efficient as to only need eight vertices to create a cube.
///
/// You've probably seen a version of the following image somewhere before.
/// ![PRIMATIVES](3d/primitives_new-640x269.gif)
/// Generally you have to create your points to fit the drawing mode that
/// you've selected because of whats called winding.
/// A vertex gets connected to another vertex in the order that the mode does
/// its winding and this means that you might need multiple vertices in a given
/// location to create the shape you want. The cube, for example, requires
/// eighteen vertices, not the eight that you would expect.
/// If you note the order of vertices in the GL chart above you'll see that all
/// of them use their vertices slightly differently (in particular you should
/// make note of the GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP example). Drawing a shape requires that
/// you keep track of which drawing mode is being used and which order
/// your vertices are declared in.
///
/// If you're thinking: it would be nice if there were an abstraction layer
/// for this you're thinking right. Enter the mesh, which is really just
/// an abstraction of the vertex and drawing mode that we started with
/// but which has the added bonus of managing the draw order for you.
/// That may seem insignificant at first, but it provides some real benefits
/// when working with complex geometry.
///
/// A very typical usage is something like the following:
///
/// ~~~~{.cpp}
/// ofMesh mesh;
/// for (int y = 0; y < height; y++){
/// 	for (int x = 0; x<width; x++){
/// 		mesh.addVertex(glm::vec3(x,y,0)); // make a new vertex
/// 		mesh.addColor(ofFloatColor(0,0,0));  // add a color at that vertex
/// 	}
/// }
/// ~~~~
///
/// Now it's important to make sure that each vertex is correctly connected
/// with the other vertices around it. This is done using indices, which you
/// can set up like so:
/// ~~~~{.cpp}
/// for (int y = 0; y<height-1; y++){
/// 	for (int x=0; x<width-1; x++){
/// 		mesh.addIndex(x+y*width);				// 0
/// 		mesh.addIndex((x+1)+y*width);			// 1
/// 		mesh.addIndex(x+(y+1)*width);			// 10
///
/// 		mesh.addIndex((x+1)+y*width);			// 1
/// 		mesh.addIndex((x+1)+(y+1)*width);		// 11
/// 		mesh.addIndex(x+(y+1)*width);			// 10
/// 	}

/// You can get a vector of ofMeshFace_ instances from any ofPrimitive like so:

/// ~~~~{.cpp}
///
/// vector<ofMeshFace_> triangles = box.getMesh().getUniqueFaces();
///
/// ~~~~
///
/// They're very handy for manipulating individual vertices or doing strange/fun
/// things with intersection and boundary testing, among many many other things.
///
/// this is always a triangle
