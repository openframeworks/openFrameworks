	/// This class calculates CRC-32 or Adler-32 checksums
	/// for arbitrary data.
	///
	/// A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is a type of hash function, which is used to produce a 
	/// small, fixed-size checksum of a larger block of data, such as a packet of network 
	/// traffic or a computer file. CRC-32 is one of the most commonly used CRC algorithms.
	///
	/// Adler-32 is a checksum algorithm which was invented by Mark Adler. 
	/// It is almost as reliable as a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check for protecting against 
	/// accidental modification of data, such as distortions occurring during a transmission, 
	/// but is significantly faster to calculate in software.
