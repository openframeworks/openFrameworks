class Foundation_API Glob
	/// This class implements glob-style pattern matching
	/// as known from Unix shells.
	///
	/// In the pattern string, '*' matches any sequence of characters,
	/// '?' matches any single character, [SET] matches any single character 
	/// in the specified set, [!SET] matches any character not in the  
	/// specified set.
	///
	/// A set is composed of characters or ranges; a range looks like
	/// character hyphen character (as in 0-9 or A-Z).
	/// [0-9a-zA-Z_] is the set of characters allowed in C identifiers.
	/// Any other character in the pattern must be matched exactly.
	///
	/// To suppress the special syntactic significance of any of '[]*?!-\',
	/// and match the character exactly, precede it with a backslash.
	///
	/// All strings are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.
