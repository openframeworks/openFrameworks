class Foundation_API NotificationQueue
	/// A NotificationQueue object provides a way to implement asynchronous
	/// notifications. This is especially useful for sending notifications
	/// from one thread to another, for example from a background thread to 
	/// the main (user interface) thread. 
	/// 
	/// The NotificationQueue can also be used to distribute work from
	/// a controlling thread to one or more worker threads. Each worker thread
	/// repeatedly calls waitDequeueNotification() and processes the
	/// returned notification. Special care must be taken when shutting
	/// down a queue with worker threads waiting for notifications.
	/// The recommended sequence to shut down and destroy the queue is to
	///   1. set a termination flag for every worker thread
	///   2. call the wakeUpAll() method
	///   3. join each worker thread
	///   4. destroy the notification queue.
