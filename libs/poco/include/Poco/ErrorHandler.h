class Foundation_API ErrorHandler
	/// This is the base class for thread error handlers.
	///
	/// An unhandled exception that causes a thread to terminate is usually
	/// silently ignored, since the class library cannot do anything meaningful
	/// about it.
	/// 
	/// The Thread class provides the possibility to register a
	/// global ErrorHandler that is invoked whenever a thread has
	/// been terminated by an unhandled exception.
	/// The ErrorHandler must be derived from this class and can
	/// provide implementations of all three exception() overloads.
	///
	/// The ErrorHandler is always invoked within the context of
	/// the offending thread.
