	/// The NodeAppender class provides a very fast way to
	/// build larger DOM documents.
	///
	/// In the DOM, child nodes are usually appended to a parent
	/// node using the appendChild() method. For nodes containing
	/// more than a few children, this method can be quite slow,
	/// due to the way it's implemented, and because of the 
	/// requirements of the DOM specification.
	///
	/// While the NodeAppender is being used on an Element, no
	/// children-modifying methods of that Element must be used.
	///
	/// This class is not part of the DOM specification.

		/// Appends the node newChild to the end of the list of children of
		/// the parent node specified in the constructor.
		/// If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed.
		///
		/// NewChild can be a DocumentFragment. In this case, all children
		/// of the fragment become children of the parent element.
		///
		/// In order to speed up the function, no DOM events
		/// are fired.
