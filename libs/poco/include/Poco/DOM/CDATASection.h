class XML_API CDATASection: public Text
	/// CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters that
	/// would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is recognized
	/// in a CDATA section is the "]]>" string that ends the CDATA section. CDATA
	/// sections cannot be nested. Their primary purpose is for including material
	/// such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all the delimiters.
	/// 
	/// The DOMString attribute of the Text node holds the text that is contained
	/// by the CDATA section. Note that this may contain characters that need to
	/// be escaped outside of CDATA sections and that, depending on the character
	/// encoding ("charset") chosen for serialization, it may be impossible to write
	/// out some characters as part of a CDATA section.
	/// 
	/// The CDATASection interface inherits from the CharacterData interface through
	/// the Text interface. Adjacent CDATASection nodes are not merged by use of
	/// the normalize method on the Element interface.
	/// 
	/// Note: Because no markup is recognized within a CDATASection, character numeric
	/// references cannot be used as an escape mechanism when serializing. Therefore,
	/// action needs to be taken when serializing a CDATASection with a character
	/// encoding where some of the contained characters cannot be represented. Failure
	/// to do so would not produce well-formed XML.
	/// One potential solution in the serialization process is to end the CDATA
	/// section before the character, output the character using a character reference
	/// or entity reference, and open a new CDATA section for any further characters
	/// in the text node. Note, however, that some code conversion libraries at
	/// the time of writing do not return an error or exception when a character
	/// is missing from the encoding, making the task of ensuring that data is not
	/// corrupted on serialization more difficult.
