class XML_API Entity: public AbstractContainerNode
	/// This interface represents an entity, either parsed or unparsed, in an XML
	/// document. Note that this models the entity itself not the entity declaration.
	/// Entity declaration modeling has been left for a later Level of the DOM
	/// specification.
	/// 
	/// The nodeName attribute that is inherited from Node contains the name of
	/// the entity.
	/// 
	/// An XML processor may choose to completely expand entities before the structure
	/// model is passed to the DOM; in this case there will be no EntityReference
	/// nodes in the document tree.
	/// 
	/// XML does not mandate that a non-validating XML processor read and process
	/// entity declarations made in the external subset or declared in external
	/// parameter entities. This means that parsed entities declared in the external
	/// subset need not be expanded by some classes of applications, and that the
	/// replacement value of the entity may not be available. When the replacement
	/// value is available, the corresponding Entity node's child list represents
	/// the structure of that replacement text. Otherwise, the child list is empty.
	/// 
	/// The resolution of the children of the Entity (the replacement value) may
	/// be lazily evaluated; actions by the user (such as calling the childNodes
	/// method on the Entity Node) are assumed to trigger the evaluation.
	/// 
	/// The DOM Level 1 does not support editing Entity nodes; if a user wants to
	/// make changes to the contents of an Entity, every related EntityReference
	/// node has to be replaced in the structure model by a clone of the Entity's
	/// contents, and then the desired changes must be made to each of those clones
	/// instead. Entity nodes and all their descendants are readonly.
	/// 
	/// An Entity node does not have any parent.
