class XML_API DocumentFragment: public AbstractContainerNode
	/// DocumentFragment is a "lightweight" or "minimal" Document object. It is
	/// very common to want to be able to extract a portion of a document's tree
	/// or to create a new fragment of a document. Imagine implementing a user command
	/// like cut or rearranging a document by moving fragments around. It is desirable
	/// to have an object which can hold such fragments and it is quite natural
	/// to use a Node for this purpose. While it is true that a Document object
	/// could fulfill this role, a Document object can potentially be a heavyweight
	/// object, depending on the underlying implementation. What is really needed
	/// for this is a very lightweight object. DocumentFragment is such an object.
	/// 
	/// Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as children of
	/// another Node -- may take DocumentFragment objects as arguments; this results
	/// in all the child nodes of the DocumentFragment being moved to the child
	/// list of this node.
	/// 
	/// The children of a DocumentFragment node are zero or more nodes representing
	/// the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of the document. DocumentFragment
	/// nodes do not need to be well-formed XML documents (although they do need
	/// to follow the rules imposed upon well-formed XML parsed entities, which
	/// can have multiple top nodes). For example, a DocumentFragment might have
	/// only one child and that child node could be a Text node. Such a structure
	/// model represents neither an HTML document nor a well-formed XML document.
	/// 
	/// When a DocumentFragment is inserted into a Document (or indeed any other
	/// Node that may take children) the children of the DocumentFragment and not
	/// the DocumentFragment itself are inserted into the Node. This makes the DocumentFragment
	/// very useful when the user wishes to create nodes that are siblings; the
	/// DocumentFragment acts as the parent of these nodes so that the user can
	/// use the standard methods from the Node interface, such as insertBefore and
	/// appendChild.
