	/// The DocumentEvent interface provides a mechanism by which the user can create

	/// implements the Document interface in an implementation which supports the
	/// Event model.

		/// The eventType parameter specifies the type of Event interface to be created.
		/// If the Event interface specified is supported by the implementation this
		/// method will return a new Event of the interface type requested. If the Event
		/// is to be dispatched via the dispatchEvent method the appropriate event init
		/// method must be called after creation in order to initialize the Event's
		/// values. As an example, a user wishing to synthesize some kind of UIEvent
		/// would call createEvent with the parameter "UIEvents". The initUIEvent method
		/// could then be called on the newly created UIEvent to set the specific type
		/// of UIEvent to be dispatched and set its context information.
		/// The createEvent method is used in creating Events when it is either inconvenient
		/// or unnecessary for the user to create an Event themselves. In cases where
		/// the implementation provided Event is insufficient, users may supply their
		/// own Event implementations for use with the dispatchEvent method.
