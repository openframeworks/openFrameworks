	/// A simple pool for fixed-size memory blocks.
	///
	/// The main purpose of this class is to speed-up
	/// memory allocations, as well as to reduce memory
	/// fragmentation in situations where the same blocks
	/// are allocated all over again, such as in server
	/// applications.
	///
	/// All allocated blocks are retained for future use.
	/// A limit on the number of blocks can be specified.
	/// Blocks can be preallocated.

	void* get();
		/// Returns a memory block. If there are no more blocks
		/// in the pool, a new block will be allocated.
		///
		/// If maxAlloc blocks are already allocated, an
