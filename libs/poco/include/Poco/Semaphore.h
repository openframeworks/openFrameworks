class Foundation_API Semaphore: private SemaphoreImpl
	/// A Semaphore is a synchronization object with the following 
	/// characteristics:
	/// A semaphore has a value that is constrained to be a non-negative
	/// integer and two atomic operations. The allowable operations are V 
	/// (here called set()) and P (here called wait()). A V (set()) operation 
	/// increases the value of the semaphore by one. 
	/// A P (wait()) operation decreases the value of the semaphore by one, 
	/// provided that can be done without violating the constraint that the 
	/// value be non-negative. A P (wait()) operation that is initiated when 
	/// the value of the semaphore is 0 suspends the calling thread. 
	/// The calling thread may continue when the value becomes positive again.
