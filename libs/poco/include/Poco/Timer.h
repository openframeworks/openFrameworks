class Foundation_API Timer: protected Runnable
	/// This class implements a thread-based timer.
	/// A timer starts a thread that first waits for a given start interval.
	/// Once that interval expires, the timer callback is called repeatedly
	/// in the given periodic interval. If the interval is 0, the timer is only
	/// called once.
	/// The timer callback method can stop the timer by setting the 
	/// timer's periodic interval to 0.
	///
	/// The timer callback runs in its own thread, so multithreading
	/// issues (proper synchronization) have to be considered when writing 
	/// the callback method.
	///
	/// The exact interval at which the callback is called depends on many 
	/// factors like operating system, CPU performance and system load and
	/// may differ from the specified interval.
	///
	/// The time needed to execute the timer callback is not included
	/// in the interval between invocations. For example, if the interval
	/// is 500 milliseconds, and the callback needs 400 milliseconds to
	/// execute, the callback function is nevertheless called every 500
	/// milliseconds. If the callback takes longer to execute than the
	/// interval, the callback function will be immediately called again
	/// once it returns.
	///
	/// The timer thread is taken from a thread pool, so
	/// there is a limit to the number of available concurrent timers.
