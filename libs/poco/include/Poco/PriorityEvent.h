	/// A PriorityEvent uses internally a DefaultStrategy which 
	/// invokes delegates in a manner determined by the priority field 
	/// in the PriorityDelegates (lower priorities first).
	/// PriorityEvents can only be used together with PriorityDelegates.
	/// PriorityDelegates are sorted according to the priority value, when
	/// two delegates have the same priority, they are invoked in
	/// an arbitrary manner.
	/// Note that one object can register several methods as long as they differ
	/// in their priority value:
	///     PriorityEvent<int> tmp;
	///     MyClass myObject;
	///     tmp += priorityDelegate(&myObject, &MyClass::myMethod1, 1);
	///     tmp += priorityDelegate(&myObject, &MyClass::myMethod2, 2);
