class Foundation_API ThreadPool
	/// A thread pool always keeps a number of threads running, ready
	/// to accept work.
	/// Creating and starting a threads can impose a significant runtime
	/// overhead to an application. A thread pool helps to improve
	/// the performance of an application by reducing the number
	/// of threads that have to be created (and destroyed again).
	/// Threads in a thread pool are re-used once they become
	/// available again.
	/// The thread pool always keeps a minimum number of threads
	/// running. If the demans for threads increases, additional
	/// threads are created. Once the demand for threads sinks
	/// again, no-longer used threads are stopped and removed
	/// from the pool.
