class Net_API FTPClientSession
	/// This class implements an File Transfer Protocol
	/// (FTP, RFC 959) client.
	///
	/// Most of the features of the FTP protocol, as specified
	/// in RFC 959, are supported. Not supported are EBCDIC and
	/// LOCAL data types and format control and structured files.
	///
	/// Also supported are the EPRT and EPSV commands from
	/// RFC 1738 (FTP Extensions for IPv6 and NAT).
	/// The client will first attempt to use the EPRT and EPSV
	/// commands. If the server does not supports these commands,
	/// the client will fall back to PORT and PASV.
