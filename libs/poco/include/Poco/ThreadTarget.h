class Foundation_API ThreadTarget: public Runnable
	/// This adapter simplifies using static member functions as well as 
	/// standalone functions as targets for threads.
	/// Note that it is possible to pass those entities directly to Thread::start().
	/// This adapter is provided as a convenience for higher abstraction level
	/// scenarios where Runnable abstract class is used.
	///
	/// For using a non-static member function as a thread target, please
	/// see the RunnableAdapter class.
	/// 
	/// Usage:
	///    class MyObject
	///    {
	///        static void doSomething() {}
	///    };
	///    ThreadTarget ra(&MyObject::doSomething);
	///    Thread thr;
	///    thr.start(ra);
	///
	/// or:
	/// 
	///    void doSomething() {}
	/// 
	///    ThreadTarget ra(doSomething);
	///    Thread thr;
	///    thr.start(ra);
