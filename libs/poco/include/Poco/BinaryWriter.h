class Foundation_API BinaryWriter
	/// This class writes basic types in binary form into an output stream.
	/// It provides an inserter-based interface similar to ostream.
	/// The writer also supports automatic conversion from big-endian
	/// (network byte order) to little-endian and vice-versa.
	/// Use a BinaryReader to read from a stream created by a BinaryWriter.
	/// Be careful when exchanging data between systems with different
	/// data type sizes (e.g., 32-bit and 64-bit architectures), as the sizes
	/// of some of the basic types may be different. For example, writing a
	/// long integer on a 64-bit system and reading it on a 32-bit system
	/// may yield an incorrent result. Use fixed-size types (Int32, Int64, etc.)
	/// in such a case.
