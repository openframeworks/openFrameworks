class Activity: public Runnable
	/// This template class helps to implement active objects.
	/// An active object uses threads to decouple method
	/// execution from method invocation, or to perform tasks
	/// autonomously, without intervention of a caller.
	///
	/// An activity is a (typically longer running) method
	/// that executes within its own task. Activities can
	/// be started automatically (upon object construction)
	/// or manually at a later time. Activities can also
	/// be stopped at any time. However, to make stopping
	/// an activity work, the method implementing the
	/// activity has to check periodically whether it
	/// has been requested to stop, and if so, return. 
	/// Activities are stopped before the object they belong to is
	/// destroyed. Methods implementing activities cannot have arguments
	/// or return values. 
	///
	/// Activity objects are used as follows:
	///
	///     class ActiveObject
	///     {
	///     public:
	///         ActiveObject(): 
	///             _activity(this, &ActiveObject::runActivity)
	///         {
	///             ...
	///         }
	///   
	///         ...
	///  
	///     protected:
	///         void runActivity()
	///         {
	///             while (!_activity.isStopped())
	///             {
	///                 ...
	///             }
	///         }
	///
	///     private:
	///         Activity<ActiveObject> _activity;
	///     };
