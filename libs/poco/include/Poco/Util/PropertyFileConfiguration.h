class Util_API PropertyFileConfiguration: public MapConfiguration
	/// This implementation of a Configuration reads properties
	/// from a Java-style properties file.
	///
	/// The file syntax is implemented as follows.
	///   - a line starting with a hash '#' or exclamation mark '!' is treated as a comment and ignored
	///   - every other line denotes a property assignment in the form
	///     <key> = <value> or
	///     <key> : <value>
	///
	/// Keys and values may contain special characters represented by the following escape sequences:
	///   - \t: tab (0x09)
	///   - \n: line feed (0x0a)
	///   - \r: carriage return (0x0d)
	///   - \f: form feed (0x0c)
	///
	/// For every other sequence that starts with a backslash, the backslash is removed.
	/// Therefore, the sequence \a would just yield an 'a'.
	///
	/// A value can spread across multiple lines if the last character in a line (the character
	/// immediately before the carriage return or line feed character) is a single backslash.
	///
	/// Property names are case sensitive. Leading and trailing whitespace is
	/// removed from both keys and values. A property name can neither contain
	/// a colon ':' nor an equal sign '=' character.
