class Foundation_API SimpleFileChannel: public Channel
	/// A Channel that writes to a file. This class only
	/// supports simple log file rotation.
	///
	/// For more features, see the FileChannel class.
	///
	/// Only the message's text is written, followed
	/// by a newline.
	///
	/// Chain this channel to a FormattingChannel with an
	/// appropriate Formatter to control what is in the text. 
	///
	/// Log file rotation based on log file size is supported.
	///
	/// If rotation is enabled, the SimpleFileChannel will 
	/// alternate between two log files. If the size of
	/// the primary log file exceeds a specified limit,
	/// the secondary log file will be used, and vice
	/// versa. 
	///
	/// Log rotation is configured with the "rotation"
	/// property, which supports the following values:
	///   * never:         no log rotation
	///   * <n>:           the file is rotated when its size exceeds
	///                    <n> bytes.
	///   * <n> K:         the file is rotated when its size exceeds
	///                    <n> Kilobytes.
	///   * <n> M:         the file is rotated when its size exceeds
	///                    <n> Megabytes.
	///
	/// The path of the (primary) log file can be specified with
	/// the "path" property. Optionally, the path of the secondary
	/// log file can be specified with the "secondaryPath" property.
	///
	/// If no secondary path is specified, the secondary path will
	/// default to <primaryPath>.1.
