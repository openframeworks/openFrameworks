	/// Interface for an XML filter.
	///
	/// An XML filter is like an XML reader, except that it obtains its events from another XML reader 
	/// rather than a primary source like an XML document or database. Filters can modify a stream of 
	/// events as they pass on to the final application.
	/// 
	/// The XMLFilterImpl helper class provides a convenient base for creating SAX2 filters, by passing on 
	/// all EntityResolver, DTDHandler, ContentHandler and ErrorHandler events automatically.

	virtual XMLReader* getParent() const = 0;
		/// Set the parent reader.
		/// 
		/// This method allows the application to link the filter to a parent reader (which may be another 
		/// filter). The argument may not be null.
		
	virtual void setParent(XMLReader* pParent) = 0;
		/// Get the parent reader.
		/// 
		/// This method allows the application to query the parent reader (which may be another filter). 
		/// It is generally a bad idea to perform any operations on the parent reader directly: they should 
		/// all pass through this filter.
