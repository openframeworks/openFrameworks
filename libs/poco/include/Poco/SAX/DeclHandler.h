class XML_API DeclHandler
	/// This is an optional extension handler for SAX2 to provide information 
	/// about DTD declarations in an XML document. XML
	/// readers are not required to support this handler, and this handler is 
	/// not included in the core SAX2 distribution.
	///
	/// Note that data-related DTD declarations (unparsed entities and notations) 
	/// are already reported through the DTDHandler interface.
	/// If you are using the declaration handler together with a lexical handler, 
	/// all of the events will occur between the startDTD and the endDTD events.
	/// To set the DeclHandler for an XML reader, use the setProperty method 
	/// with the propertyId "http://xml.org/sax/properties/declaration-handler". 
	/// If the reader does not support declaration events, it will throw a
	/// SAXNotRecognizedException or a SAXNotSupportedException when you attempt to 
	/// register the handler.
