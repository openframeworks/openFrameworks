class Foundation_API TimedNotificationQueue
	/// A TimedNotificationQueue object provides a way to implement timed, asynchronous
	/// notifications. This is especially useful for sending notifications
	/// from one thread to another, for example from a background thread to 
	/// the main (user interface) thread. 
	///
	/// The TimedNotificationQueue is quite similar to the NotificationQueue class.
	/// The only difference to NotificationQueue is that each Notification is tagged
	/// with a Timestamp. When inserting a Notification into the queue, the
	/// Notification is inserted according to the given Timestamp, with 
	/// lower Timestamp values being inserted before higher ones.
	///
	/// Notifications are dequeued in order of their timestamps.
	///
	/// TimedNotificationQueue has some restrictions regarding multithreaded use.
	/// While multiple threads may enqueue notifications, only one thread at a
	/// time may dequeue notifications from the queue.
	///
	/// If two threads try to dequeue a notification simultaneously, the results
	/// are undefined.

		/// a call like
		///     notificationQueue.enqueueNotification(new MyNotification, someTime);
