/* XXX map/unmap, general surface layer? */

/* Rough outline, culled from a conversation on IRC:
 *   map() returns an image-surface representation of the drm-surface,
 *   which you unmap() when you are finished, i.e. map() pulls the buffer back
 *   from the GPU, maps it into the CPU domain and gives you direct access to
 *   the pixels.  With the unmap(), the buffer is ready to be used again by the
 *   GPU and *until* the unmap(), all operations will be done in software.
 *
 *  (Technically calling cairo_surface_flush() on the underlying drm-surface
 *  will also disassociate the mapping.)
