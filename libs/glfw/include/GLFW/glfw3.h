 *   - For non-alphanumeric characters, Unicode:ish names are used (e.g.

 *     correspond to the Unicode standard (usually for brevity)
 *   - Keys that lack a clear US mapping are named "WORLD_x"
 *   - For non-printable keys, custom names are used (e.g. "F4",

 *  This function creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES

 *
 *  Successful creation does not change which context is current.  Before you
 *  can use the newly created context, you need to
 *  [make it current](@ref context_current).  For information about the `share`
 *  parameter, see @ref context_sharing.
 *
 *  The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you
 *  requested, as not all parameters and hints are
 *  [hard constraints](@ref window_hints_hard).  This includes the size of the
 *  window, especially for full screen windows.  To query the actual attributes
 *  of the created window, framebuffer and context, use queries like @ref
 *  glfwGetWindowAttrib and @ref glfwGetWindowSize.
 *
 *  To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window
 *  will cover.  If no monitor is specified, windowed mode will be used.  Unless
 *  you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is recommended
 *  that you pick the primary monitor.  For more information on how to query
 *  connected monitors, see @ref monitor_monitors.
 *
 *  For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the
 *  window's _desired video mode_.  As long as a full screen window has input
 *  focus, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video mode
 *  is set for the specified monitor.  For more information about full screen
 *  windows, including the creation of so called _windowed full screen_ or
 *  _borderless full screen_ windows, see @ref window_windowed_full_screen.
 *
 *  By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the
 *  window system.  To create the window at a specific position, make it
 *  initially invisible using the [GLFW_VISIBLE](@ref window_hints_wnd) window
 *  hint, set its [position](@ref window_pos) and then [show](@ref window_hide)
 *  it.
 *
 *  If a full screen window has input focus, the screensaver is prohibited from
 *  starting.
 *
 *  Window systems put limits on window sizes.  Very large or very small window
 *  dimensions may be overridden by the window system on creation.  Check the
 *  actual [size](@ref window_size) after creation.
 *
 *  The [swap interval](@ref buffer_swap) is not set during window creation and
 *  the initial value may vary depending on driver settings and defaults.
 *
 *  @param[in] width The desired width, in screen coordinates, of the window.
 *  This must be greater than zero.
 *  @param[in] height The desired height, in screen coordinates, of the window.
 *  This must be greater than zero.
 *  @param[in] title The initial, UTF-8 encoded window title.
 *  @param[in] monitor The monitor to use for full screen mode, or `NULL` to use
 *  windowed mode.
 *  @param[in] share The window whose context to share resources with, or `NULL`
 *  to not share resources.
 *  @return The handle of the created window, or `NULL` if an

 *
 *  @remarks __Windows:__ If the executable has an icon resource named
 *  `GLFW_ICON,` it will be set as the icon for the window.  If no such icon is
 *  present, the `IDI_WINLOGO` icon will be used instead.
 *
 *  @remarks __Windows:__ The context to share resources with may not be current
 *  on any other thread.
 *
 *  @remarks __OS X:__ The GLFW window has no icon, as it is not a document
 *  window, but the dock icon will be the same as the application bundle's icon.
