OF 0071, changelog:

key:
+ = added
- = subtracted
/ = modified
---------------------------------------------------------------

The main focus for 0071 was to add new examples to better show the features added in 007. 
0071 is mainly an 'examples + bug fixes' release, with some additional, much needed, updating to the mobile releases ( iOS and Android ). 

Critical changes ( might need to update your projects to fix )
* ofEvents -> ofEvents() singleton - this means that projects which register calls using "ofEvents." will need to replace these with "ofEvents()." (note the parentheses).
* OF Examples now are found in the "examples/" folder in the root of the OF folder. The "apps/" is still included but is kept empty as a place to put your OF apps and experiments. 
* Because of the project generator (see below) some addons have been standardized, and we've added "addons.make" to each project file that uses addons.  Prior to this release, addons.make was only used on linux / android platforms.  As we develop the project generator, we'll work to document these changes. 
* audioRequested and audioReceived on the ofBaseApp/testApp are now called audioOut and audioIn


Project generator
A significant amount of the work which went into 0071 was in the development of a Project Generator. The Project Generator can make project files for all the OF platforms and it was critical to have this in order to increase the number of examples we could include with the release. The Project Generator is also able to add addons to existing projects, making the task of adding addons much faster than the current manual approach. Going forward, the Project Generator will be included with the new releases and be a key tool for generating, modifying and updating your OF projects. Currently, the Project Generator is in our github repository (https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) in apps/devApps/.

OF 007, changelog:

key:
+ = added
- = subtracted
/ = modified

---------------------------------------------------------------

This is the biggest release yet. There are a ton of changes. The 0062 core was 624KB over 49 files. The 007 core is 1.12MB, 148 files. In other words, the core of OF has basically doubled.

Some of the favorite changes to OF include:
* PDF and SVG export with cairo
* ofMesh, ofPolyline utils and ofPath tessellation
* advanced ofColor support, like fromHex() and fromHsb()
* web-based resource and image loading
* advanced ofPixels power like getColor(x, y)
* the new Assimp addon
* advanced logging capabilities
* the ofPtr shared pointer, and shallow copy semantics: it's now safe to copy ofTexture
* moving ofxVectorMath, ofxDirList, ofxThread, and the previously unofficial ofxShader, ofxFbo, ofxVbo all into the core

Here's a fairly complete list of the changes.

core changes
+ drag and drop support in applications (except in linux)
+ ofPtr for shared pointers, is actually std::tr1::shared_ptr and will be std::shared_ptr when c++11 is supported
/ ofVideoGrabber, ofVideoPlayer, ofSoundPlayer and ofSoundStream use "swappable apis". so does rendering, which means you can use cairo and output to PDFs or SVG for 2d and 3d.
/ new fps counting technique that works a little better across platforms
/ ofApp*Window have been refactored so now all the common functionality is in ofEvents which makes easier to create new windows and maintain the current ones
/ easier registering of core events with the new ofRegister*Events functions
/ all the classes with opengl resources have shallow copy + shared pointer semantics so textureA = textureB makes textureB point to the same texture in the graphics card as textureA, and the texture is released when the last copy is destroyed
/ all swappable api objects (ofVideoGrabber, ofVideoPlayer, ofSoundPlayer and ofSoundStream) have shallow copy + shared pointer semantics too
/ all memory structures (ofPixels, ofImage, ofBuffer, ofMesh...) have deep copy semantics, so pixelsA = pixelsB makes b a full new copy of pixelsA
/ Poco library is changed from 1.3.3 to 1.4 

video and cv
+ ofxCvHaarFinder is brought into the core ofxOpenCv addon
/ openCV is updated to 2.2
/ better gstreamer support on linux

2d
+ ofImage uses new web-based loading
+ ofPath and ofPolyline wraps all the 2d drawing functionality previously supported by OF, and adds more. ofPolyline has some new advanced methods like getResampledBySpacing(), getClosestPoint(), simplify()
+ ofSetOrientation() allows you to rotate the entire OF drawing space
+ ofPixels and ofImage have getColor() which returns an ofColor, and setColor(x,y,ofColor)
+ ofEnableBlendMode() supports additive, subtractive, alpha, etc. blending
+ ofColor has constants for 8 basic colors (cmy, rgb, bw), for example ofColor::magenta
+ ofColor finally adds HSB support. ofColor is always an RGB color, but you can get and set its hue, saturation and lightness via getHue()/setHue() etc. it also distinguishes lightness (value) from brightness. to create a color using HSB values, use ofColor::fromHsb(h,s,b,a). to set from hex, use ofColor::fromHex(hex)
/ ofColor, ofPixels and ofImage are now templated classes with support for 8bit, 16bit and 32bit and easy conversion between them using the = operator
/ ofDrawBitmapString() has been massively refactored to support all the different 3d drawing cases you can imagine via ofSetDrawBitmapMode()
/ ofPixels is now a fully-formed class that is used by a variety of classes
/ ofSetColor(int) is now interpreted as a grayscale value, ofSetHexColor(int) if you want to use hex values
/ ofTrueTypeFont, now generates a texture atlas when loading a font instead of a texture per char. It also has bind()/unbind() functions that allow to bind the texture only once to render several texts, making font rendering much faster.
/ ofTrueTypeFont getShapes uses ofPath
/ new ofTessellator class used internally in OF by ofPath and ofBegin/EndShape bassed on the tess2 library (with some modifications so it also works on openGL ES) which is faster and has a cleaner api than the previous one from GLU

3d
+ ofMesh, ofVbo and ofVboMesh provide a clean interface for drawing, and for gpu-accelerated drawing
+ ofNode is a new 3d node class with position and orientation that can be manipulated with methods like truck() and tilt()
+ ofCamera extends ofNode, is a new camera class for representing a camera position, orientation, and other parameters
+ ofEasyCam wraps ofCamera with automatic mouse binding that resembles processing's PeasyCam
+ ofLight also extends ofNode, provides a simple interface for placing and describing opengl lighting
+ ofBox and ofSphere draw the respective 3d shapes
+ multiple versions of ofxShader, ofxVbo and ofxFbo have been brought into the core as ofShader, ofVbo, and ofFbo
+ ofxAssimpModelLoader for loading a huge variety of 3d formats

utils
+ functions and classes to load resources from the web to memory, or save to disk. using HTTP, either synchronously and asynchronously: ofSaveURLTo(), ofSaveURLAsync()
+ added the ofxThreadedImageLoader addon
+ cross-platform file dialog and alert dialog, ofSystemAlertDialog(), ofSystemLoadDialog(), ofSystemSaveDialog()
+ a ton of conversion methods have been added: ofToHex, ofToBinary, ofToString, ofHexToInt, ofHexToFloat, etc. they're all inside ofUtils.h
+ ofFile and ofBuffer have also been added for working with the filesystem
/ the core addons ofxVectorMath, ofxThread, and ofxDirList have been turned into ofVectorMath, ofThread and ofDirectory
/ new logging system with support for << operator, for example: ofLogVerbose() << "some message", logging to file and logging channels which makes it easier to redirect the logging output

sound
+ working towards a sound synthesis addon, ofxSynth
/ slowly transitioning away from fmod toward openal for sound support
/ ofSoundStream has been converted to an object oriented api, and now is possible to open several devices and choose which device you want to use.
- FMOD is removed on linux, so there are no dependencies with any non-free library

mobile
+ android support
/ better iPhone video and camera support

OF 0061 Pre-release, changelog:

key:
+ = added
- = subtracted
/ = modified

---------------------------------------------------------------
major changes:

- In this release we've moved to a *compiled* openFrameworks library as opposed to un-compiled.  a few motivations:  cutting down on directory size of OF, reducing redundant compiles, making compile times faster and making development of OF easier.   This changes quite a bit the organization of projects but it should lead to a much easier to use and maintain OF.

- we've moved from svn to git / github, and now have an automated system of building the OF package.  This should also greatly ease our development of openFrameworks.  Before we had separate SVNs for the OF lib, the OF examples, and the core addons.  Now, we've got one major place where changes and development of OF can be tracked.   see http://github.com/openFrameworks/openFrameworks.

- To encourage faster releases, we've moved to a major / minor release schedule, with minor releases (0061, 0062) relating to bug fixes and major releases (007, 008) relating to major features.  

core: 

/ folder structure is now changed so that all ide/packages can share one directory structure. Download the 0061 all release to check it out.
- core addons now don't have libs from other platforms
- core addons now don't have example project in the addons folder
/ core FreeImage.h -> move BOOL typedefs etc to #defines and do #undef at the end
+ Put MIT license in OF headers

OSX: 

+ xcode has snow leopard fixes, and an SL release
/ xcode projects are now renamed to have the folder name (ie, every project has a unique target name)
/ xcode apps now have max optimization settings for release.
+ xcode now has 3 build modes, Debug, Release, Release Universal.  Debug and Release are for your current platform (either intel or PPC), Release Universal is for both.
/ renamed libs - change all libSomething.a to be something.a - this prevents xcode linking to root level dynamic libraries. 

Win32 CodeBlocks:

+ added Poco linker flag for CB - needed for some network calls
/ fixed Poco linking order on win32.

linux: 

+ changed the linux default videograbber to gstreamer
- remove ofV4lUtils
/ smarter makefiles
/ modified install scripts to fix karmic problems &amp; build OF compile on install

examples: 

/ fixed missing files, missing calls to windowResized, removed unnecessary calls to ofSetupSCreen() and include stdio. 

app: 

/ Fullscreen on OS X is not top level anymore (no more crazy fullscreen app crashes and can't escape).
/ OSX now using custom GLUT framework
/ ofSetBackgroundAuto(false) on windows OF now works for accumulation in both windowed and fullscreen mode.
/ Windows FPS issues have been fixed.
/ closing the window on PC now exits the application properly.
/ ofAppGlutWindow - frameRate is now set to 60.0 at the start - before it was un-initialized.
+ ofGetLastFrameTime - to get the elapsed time of the last frame.
/ fixes for ofGetWidth() &amp; ofGetHeight() being super slow, we now store them in vars and change on windowResize
+ ofGetAppPtr(), returns a pointer to the baseApp.
+ glutInitDisplayString option for initializing glut with a unique string, useful for FSAA or altering the setup.
/ fixed vertical sync for linux: http://www.openframeworks/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=561&amp;p=10683#p10683
+ ofBaseVideo added isFrameNew()

utils: 

+ ofxNoise / ofxSignedNoise - Added simplex ( similar to perlin ) noise to core
+ ofBaseHasTexture now has ofSetUseTexture ( to enable / disable use of the texture )
+ ofBaseImage and ofBaseVideo have the same inheritance base
/ ofMap - now has a clamp argument, defaults to false
/ ofMap - added kyle's solution for division by 0 in ofMap: http://www.openframeworks/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=1413&amp;view=unread#unread
/ detect C:/ as a root path in ofToDataPath
/ fixed ofPoint warnings

events: 

/ fixed vs2008 intellisense doesn't like using Poco::delegate; in ofEventUtils: http://www.openframeworks/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1877

graphics: 

/ ofImage - Loading a corrupted image in linux made the app crash, fixed now.
/ ofImage setImageType now should properly alter the texture if we need to.
+ ofTexture - get texPoint / texPercent, should help for doing texCoordinate stuff without knowing the target of the texture (ie, RECTANGLE_2D or ARB)
+ ofTexture - setTextureWrap &amp; setMinMagFilters
+ ofTexture - ofTexture float *, char *, short * -- added ability to make floating point textures, or upload float data.
/ ofTrueTypeFont - fixed TTF mem leak - http://www.openframeworks/forum/viewtopic.php?p=10178&#p10178
/ ofImage fixed resize color bug
/ ofImage inline functions cause problems with inhereited classes that want to use them in CB. Switch inline -> static fixes this issue.
/ ofGraphics - numCirclePts was being stored on ofPushStyle but not used, fixed now.
/ ofTrueTypeFont - Xcode projects now use the same version of the freetype as win/linux
+ ofSetCurveResolution - makes curved shapes a lot faster!
/ setAnchorPoint - move arguments from int to float

communication:

OF 006 Pre-release, changelog:

key:
+ = added
- = subtracted
/ = modified

---------------------------------------------------------------
major changes:

-- in this release we've added another library Poco, v 1.3.3 ( http://pocoproject.org ),
just now only used for events but is included in the core available for addons like ofxHttpUtils.
For java folks, Poco is a bit like the java sdk (java.io, java.util, java.net, etc)
-- added the event system for base events (setup, update, draw, mouse, keyboard) and constructing new events.
-- dropped the addons.h system in place of direct inclusion of addons .h files.  Old code will get warnings but not break for this release
-- abstracted the window toolkit, so that other windowing toolkits besides glut can be used with OF, such as iphone, glfw, non-windowed (command line).
-- all graphics have been opengl-es-ified, allowing for iphone support
-- all objects have virtual destructors (thanks memo for the tip)
-- all objects that draw can return their internal texture
-- adding base types for OF object (ofBaseDraws, ofBaseHasPixels) which should allow better OOP programming with OF
-- added advanced user functionality, like choosing the ARB extension usage, disabling setupScreen, binding of textures, etc.
-- tons and tons of bug fixes and small functions (ofClamp, push and pop styles) that should make programming in OF easier

---------------------------------------------------------------

OF 004 Pre-release, changelog:

key:
+ = added
- = subtracted
/ = modified

---------------------------------------------------------------
major changes:

-- fixed an issue with addons include, now its a system with ofCore.h / ofMain.h / ofAddons.h
-- addons folder added to the setup

---------------------------------------------------------------
a brief explanation about addons:

now the structure look like:

-- apps
-- libs
-- addons

where libs are the core libraries for OF (which shouldn't change much), and addons is everything else.  

Adding a library will work in the following way:

a) add to the addons folder everything downloaded
b) add to addons.h the "addon.h" lines (found in addon instructions), such as:

#ifdef OFADDON_USING_OF_CV
	#include "ofCvMain.h"
#endif

c) follow any steps about adding includes, sources, and libs to the project (or makefile)
d) when you want to use the addon, use the #define before including ofMain in testApp.h, such as:

#define	 	OFADDON_USING_OF_CV
#define	 	OFADDON_USING_OF_VECTOR_MATH
#include 	"ofMain.h"
e) place any dll / .so files in the right place (after compiling)

---------------------------------------------------------------
other changes: 

/ 	ofGraphics - fixed a bug with OS X, 10.5 compiling
/ 	ofSerial - fixed a bug with win32 destructor
/ 	ofVideoGrabber - mac grabber fixed bug with settings loading
/ 	ofMain - is now just ofCore and ofAddons
+ 	ofAddons - is the place where addons will go
+ 	ofCore - is the what ofMain was, all the "core" OF code  (internal and addons should include "core" not main to avoid recursive linking)
/ 	movie grabber example - win32 / fixed an issue where some of the code was commented out.
