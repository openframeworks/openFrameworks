Description: open-source C++ toolkit for creative experimentation
 openFrameworks is designed to work as a general purpose glue, and wraps
 together several commonly used libraries, including:
 - OpenGL, GLEW, libtess2 and cairo for graphics
 - rtAudio, PortAudio, OpenAL and Kiss FFT or FMOD for audio input, output
   and analysis
 - FreeType for fonts
 - FreeImage for image saving and loading
 - Quicktime, GStreamer and videoInput for video playback and grabbing
 - Poco for a variety of utilities
 - OpenCV for computer vision
 - Assimp for 3D model loading
