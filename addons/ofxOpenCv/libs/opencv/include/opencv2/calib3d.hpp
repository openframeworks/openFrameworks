  @defgroup calib3d Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction

The functions in this section use a so-called pinhole camera model. In this model, a scene view is
formed by projecting 3D points into the image plane using a perspective transformation.

\f[s  \; m' = A [R|t] M'\f]

or

\f[s  \vecthree{u}{v}{1} = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_1  \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_2  \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_3
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z \\
1
\end{bmatrix}\f]

where:

-   \f$(X, Y, Z)\f$ are the coordinates of a 3D point in the world coordinate space
-   \f$(u, v)\f$ are the coordinates of the projection point in pixels
-   \f$A\f$ is a camera matrix, or a matrix of intrinsic parameters
-   \f$(cx, cy)\f$ is a principal point that is usually at the image center
-   \f$fx, fy\f$ are the focal lengths expressed in pixel units.

Thus, if an image from the camera is scaled by a factor, all of these parameters should be scaled
(multiplied/divided, respectively) by the same factor. The matrix of intrinsic parameters does not
depend on the scene viewed. So, once estimated, it can be re-used as long as the focal length is
fixed (in case of zoom lens). The joint rotation-translation matrix \f$[R|t]\f$ is called a matrix of
extrinsic parameters. It is used to describe the camera motion around a static scene, or vice versa,
rigid motion of an object in front of a still camera. That is, \f$[R|t]\f$ translates coordinates of a
point \f$(X, Y, Z)\f$ to a coordinate system, fixed with respect to the camera. The transformation above
is equivalent to the following (when \f$z \ne 0\f$ ):

\f[\begin{array}{l}
\vecthree{x}{y}{z} = R  \vecthree{X}{Y}{Z} + t \\
x' = x/z \\
y' = y/z \\
u = f_x*x' + c_x \\
v = f_y*y' + c_y
\end{array}\f]

Real lenses usually have some distortion, mostly radial distortion and slight tangential distortion.
So, the above model is extended as:

\f[\begin{array}{l}
\vecthree{x}{y}{z} = R  \vecthree{X}{Y}{Z} + t \\
x' = x/z \\
y' = y/z \\
x'' = x'  \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + 2 p_1 x' y' + p_2(r^2 + 2 x'^2) + s_1 r^2 + s_2 r^4 \\
y'' = y'  \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + p_1 (r^2 + 2 y'^2) + 2 p_2 x' y' + s_3 r^2 + s_4 r^4 \\
\text{where} \quad r^2 = x'^2 + y'^2  \\
u = f_x*x'' + c_x \\
v = f_y*y'' + c_y
\end{array}\f]

\f$k_1\f$, \f$k_2\f$, \f$k_3\f$, \f$k_4\f$, \f$k_5\f$, and \f$k_6\f$ are radial distortion coefficients. \f$p_1\f$ and \f$p_2\f$ are
tangential distortion coefficients. \f$s_1\f$, \f$s_2\f$, \f$s_3\f$, and \f$s_4\f$, are the thin prism distortion
coefficients. Higher-order coefficients are not considered in OpenCV.

In some cases the image sensor may be tilted in order to focus an oblique plane in front of the
camera (Scheimpfug condition). This can be useful for particle image velocimetry (PIV) or
triangulation with a laser fan. The tilt causes a perspective distortion of \f$x''\f$ and
\f$y''\f$. This distortion can be modelled in the following way, see e.g. @cite Louhichi07.

\f[\begin{array}{l}
s\vecthree{x'''}{y'''}{1} =
\vecthreethree{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{0}{-R_{13}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{-R_{23}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{0}{1} R(\tau_x, \tau_y) \vecthree{x''}{y''}{1}\\
u = f_x*x''' + c_x \\
v = f_y*y''' + c_y
\end{array}\f]

where the matrix \f$R(\tau_x, \tau_y)\f$ is defined by two rotations with angular parameter \f$\tau_x\f$
and \f$\tau_y\f$, respectively,

\f[
R(\tau_x, \tau_y) =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{1}{0}{\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{\cos(\tau_y)}
\vecthreethree{1}{0}{0}{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_x)} =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{\sin(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{-\sin(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}
{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}
{\sin(\tau_y)}{-\cos(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}.
\f]

In the functions below the coefficients are passed or returned as

\f[(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6 [, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \tau_x, \tau_y]]]])\f]

vector. That is, if the vector contains four elements, it means that \f$k_3=0\f$ . The distortion
coefficients do not depend on the scene viewed. Thus, they also belong to the intrinsic camera
parameters. And they remain the same regardless of the captured image resolution. If, for example, a
camera has been calibrated on images of 320 x 240 resolution, absolutely the same distortion
coefficients can be used for 640 x 480 images from the same camera while \f$f_x\f$, \f$f_y\f$, \f$c_x\f$, and
\f$c_y\f$ need to be scaled appropriately.

The functions below use the above model to do the following:

-   Project 3D points to the image plane given intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
-   Compute extrinsic parameters given intrinsic parameters, a few 3D points, and their
projections.
-   Estimate intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from several views of a known calibration
pattern (every view is described by several 3D-2D point correspondences).
-   Estimate the relative position and orientation of the stereo camera "heads" and compute the
*rectification* transformation that makes the camera optical axes parallel.

/** @brief Finds a perspective transformation between two planes.

or vector\<Point2f\> .
@param dstPoints Coordinates of the points in the target plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2 or
a vector\<Point2f\> .
@param method Method used to computed a homography matrix. The following methods are possible:
-   **0** - a regular method using all the points
-   **RANSAC** - RANSAC-based robust method
-   **LMEDS** - Least-Median robust method
-   **RHO**    - PROSAC-based robust method
@param ransacReprojThreshold Maximum allowed reprojection error to treat a point pair as an inlier
(used in the RANSAC and RHO methods only). That is, if
\f[\| \texttt{dstPoints} _i -  \texttt{convertPointsHomogeneous} ( \texttt{H} * \texttt{srcPoints} _i) \|  >  \texttt{ransacReprojThreshold}\f]
then the point \f$i\f$ is considered an outlier. If srcPoints and dstPoints are measured in pixels,
it usually makes sense to set this parameter somewhere in the range of 1 to 10.
@param mask Optional output mask set by a robust method ( RANSAC or LMEDS ). Note that the input
mask values are ignored.
@param maxIters The maximum number of RANSAC iterations, 2000 is the maximum it can be.
@param confidence Confidence level, between 0 and 1.

The functions find and return the perspective transformation \f$H\f$ between the source and the
destination planes:

\f[s_i  \vecthree{x'_i}{y'_i}{1} \sim H  \vecthree{x_i}{y_i}{1}\f]

so that the back-projection error

\f[\sum _i \left ( x'_i- \frac{h_{11} x_i + h_{12} y_i + h_{13}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2+ \left ( y'_i- \frac{h_{21} x_i + h_{22} y_i + h_{23}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2\f]

is minimized. If the parameter method is set to the default value 0, the function uses all the point
pairs to compute an initial homography estimate with a simple least-squares scheme.

However, if not all of the point pairs ( \f$srcPoints_i\f$, \f$dstPoints_i\f$ ) fit the rigid perspective
transformation (that is, there are some outliers), this initial estimate will be poor. In this case,
you can use one of the three robust methods. The methods RANSAC, LMeDS and RHO try many different
random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each), estimate the homography matrix
using this subset and a simple least-square algorithm, and then compute the quality/goodness of the
computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC or the median re-projection error for
LMeDs). The best subset is then used to produce the initial estimate of the homography matrix and
the mask of inliers/outliers.

Regardless of the method, robust or not, the computed homography matrix is refined further (using
inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the
re-projection error even more.

The methods RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to
distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works
correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers. Finally, if there are no outliers and the
noise is rather small, use the default method (method=0).

The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is
determined up to a scale. Thus, it is normalized so that \f$h_{33}=1\f$. Note that whenever an H matrix
cannot be estimated, an empty one will be returned.

@param jacobian Optional output 2Nx(10+\<numDistCoeffs\>) jacobian matrix of derivatives of image
points with respect to components of the rotation vector, translation vector, focal lengths,
coordinates of the principal point and the distortion coefficients. In the old interface different
components of the jacobian are returned via different output parameters.
@param aspectRatio Optional "fixed aspect ratio" parameter. If the parameter is not 0, the
function assumes that the aspect ratio (*fx/fy*) is fixed and correspondingly adjusts the jacobian
matrix.

The function computes projections of 3D points to the image plane given intrinsic and extrinsic
camera parameters. Optionally, the function computes Jacobians - matrices of partial derivatives of
image points coordinates (as functions of all the input parameters) with respect to the particular
parameters, intrinsic and/or extrinsic. The Jacobians are used during the global optimization in
calibrateCamera, solvePnP, and stereoCalibrate . The function itself can also be used to compute a
re-projection error given the current intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

@note By setting rvec=tvec=(0,0,0) or by setting cameraMatrix to a 3x3 identity matrix, or by
passing zero distortion coefficients, you can get various useful partial cases of the function. This
means that you can compute the distorted coordinates for a sparse set of points or apply a
perspective transformation (and also compute the derivatives) in the ideal zero-distortion setup.

-   **CALIB_CB_FAST_CHECK** Run a fast check on the image that looks for chessboard corners,
and shortcut the call if none is found. This can drastically speed up the call in the
degenerate condition when no chessboard is observed.

The function attempts to determine whether the input image is a view of the chessboard pattern and
locate the internal chessboard corners. The function returns a non-zero value if all of the corners
are found and they are placed in a certain order (row by row, left to right in every row).
Otherwise, if the function fails to find all the corners or reorder them, it returns 0. For example,
a regular chessboard has 8 x 8 squares and 7 x 7 internal corners, that is, points where the black
squares touch each other. The detected coordinates are approximate, and to determine their positions
more accurately, the function calls cornerSubPix. You also may use the function cornerSubPix with
different parameters if returned coordinates are not accurate enough.

Sample usage of detecting and drawing chessboard corners: :
@code
    Size patternsize(8,6); //interior number of corners
    Mat gray = ....; //source image

the vectors will be different. The points are 3D, but since they are in a pattern coordinate system,

@param rvecs Output vector of rotation vectors (see Rodrigues ) estimated for each pattern view
(e.g. std::vector<cv::Mat>>). That is, each k-th rotation vector together with the corresponding
k-th translation vector (see the next output parameter description) brings the calibration pattern
from the model coordinate space (in which object points are specified) to the world coordinate
space, that is, a real position of the calibration pattern in the k-th pattern view (k=0.. *M* -1).
@param tvecs Output vector of translation vectors estimated for each pattern view.
@param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of the following values:
-   **CV_CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS** cameraMatrix contains valid initial values of
fx, fy, cx, cy that are optimized further. Otherwise, (cx, cy) is initially set to the image
center ( imageSize is used), and focal distances are computed in a least-squares fashion.
Note, that if intrinsic parameters are known, there is no need to use this function just to
estimate extrinsic parameters. Use solvePnP instead.
-   **CV_CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT** The principal point is not changed during the global
optimization. It stays at the center or at a different location specified when
CV_CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set too.
-   **CV_CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO** The functions considers only fy as a free parameter. The
ratio fx/fy stays the same as in the input cameraMatrix . When
CV_CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set, the actual input values of fx and fy are
ignored, only their ratio is computed and used further.
-   **CV_CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST** Tangential distortion coefficients \f$(p_1, p_2)\f$ are set
to zeros and stay zero.
-   **CV_CALIB_FIX_K1,...,CV_CALIB_FIX_K6** The corresponding radial distortion
coefficient is not changed during the optimization. If CV_CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is
set, the coefficient from the supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
-   **CV_CALIB_RATIONAL_MODEL** Coefficients k4, k5, and k6 are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the rational model and return 8 coefficients. If the flag is not
set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
-   **CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL** Coefficients s1, s2, s3 and s4 are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the thin prism model and return 12 coefficients. If the flag is not
set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
-   **CALIB_FIX_S1_S2_S3_S4** The thin prism distortion coefficients are not changed during
the optimization. If CV_CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
-   **CALIB_TILTED_MODEL** Coefficients tauX and tauY are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the tilted sensor model and return 14 coefficients. If the flag is not
set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
-   **CALIB_FIX_TAUX_TAUY** The coefficients of the tilted sensor model are not changed during
the optimization. If CV_CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
@param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.

The function estimates the intrinsic camera parameters and extrinsic parameters for each of the
views. The algorithm is based on @cite Zhang2000 and @cite BouguetMCT . The coordinates of 3D object
points and their corresponding 2D projections in each view must be specified. That may be achieved
by using an object with a known geometry and easily detectable feature points. Such an object is
called a calibration rig or calibration pattern, and OpenCV has built-in support for a chessboard as
a calibration rig (see findChessboardCorners ). Currently, initialization of intrinsic parameters
(when CV_CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set) is only implemented for planar calibration
patterns (where Z-coordinates of the object points must be all zeros). 3D calibration rigs can also
be used as long as initial cameraMatrix is provided.

The algorithm performs the following steps:

-   Compute the initial intrinsic parameters (the option only available for planar calibration
    patterns) or read them from the input parameters. The distortion coefficients are all set to
    zeros initially unless some of CV_CALIB_FIX_K? are specified.

-   Estimate the initial camera pose as if the intrinsic parameters have been already known. This is
    done using solvePnP .

-   Run the global Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm to minimize the reprojection error,
    that is, the total sum of squared distances between the observed feature points imagePoints and
    the projected (using the current estimates for camera parameters and the poses) object points
    objectPoints. See projectPoints for details.

The function returns the final re-projection error.

@note
   If you use a non-square (=non-NxN) grid and findChessboardCorners for calibration, and
    calibrateCamera returns bad values (zero distortion coefficients, an image center very far from
    (w/2-0.5,h/2-0.5), and/or large differences between \f$f_x\f$ and \f$f_y\f$ (ratios of 10:1 or more)),
    then you have probably used patternSize=cvSize(rows,cols) instead of using
    patternSize=cvSize(cols,rows) in findChessboardCorners .

set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
-   **CALIB_FIX_TAUX_TAUY** The coefficients of the tilted sensor model are not changed during

@param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.

The function estimates transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair. If you have a stereo
camera where the relative position and orientation of two cameras is fixed, and if you computed
poses of an object relative to the first camera and to the second camera, (R1, T1) and (R2, T2),
respectively (this can be done with solvePnP ), then those poses definitely relate to each other.
This means that, given ( \f$R_1\f$,\f$T_1\f$ ), it should be possible to compute ( \f$R_2\f$,\f$T_2\f$ ). You only
need to know the position and orientation of the second camera relative to the first camera. This is
what the described function does. It computes ( \f$R\f$,\f$T\f$ ) so that:

\f[R_2=R*R_1
T_2=R*T_1 + T,\f]

Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E:

\f[E= \vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} *R\f]

where \f$T_i\f$ are components of the translation vector \f$T\f$ : \f$T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T\f$ . And the function
can also compute the fundamental matrix F:

\f[F = cameraMatrix2^{-T} E cameraMatrix1^{-1}\f]

Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of
two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the input
data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be
estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using
calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass CV_CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the
function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are
estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass
CV_CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and CV_CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a
reasonable assumption.

Similarly to calibrateCamera , the function minimizes the total re-projection error for all the
points in all the available views from both cameras. The function returns the final value of the
re-projection error.

/** @brief Computes rectification transforms for each head of a calibrated stereo camera.

@param cameraMatrix1 First camera matrix.
@param distCoeffs1 First camera distortion parameters.
@param cameraMatrix2 Second camera matrix.
@param distCoeffs2 Second camera distortion parameters.
@param imageSize Size of the image used for stereo calibration.
@param R Rotation matrix between the coordinate systems of the first and the second cameras.
@param T Translation vector between coordinate systems of the cameras.
@param R1 Output 3x3 rectification transform (rotation matrix) for the first camera.
@param R2 Output 3x3 rectification transform (rotation matrix) for the second camera.
@param P1 Output 3x4 projection matrix in the new (rectified) coordinate systems for the first
camera.
@param P2 Output 3x4 projection matrix in the new (rectified) coordinate systems for the second
camera.
@param Q Output \f$4 \times 4\f$ disparity-to-depth mapping matrix (see reprojectImageTo3D ).
@param flags Operation flags that may be zero or CV_CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY . If the flag is set,
the function makes the principal points of each camera have the same pixel coordinates in the
rectified views. And if the flag is not set, the function may still shift the images in the
horizontal or vertical direction (depending on the orientation of epipolar lines) to maximize the
useful image area.
@param alpha Free scaling parameter. If it is -1 or absent, the function performs the default
scaling. Otherwise, the parameter should be between 0 and 1. alpha=0 means that the rectified
images are zoomed and shifted so that only valid pixels are visible (no black areas after
rectification). alpha=1 means that the rectified image is decimated and shifted so that all the
pixels from the original images from the cameras are retained in the rectified images (no source
image pixels are lost). Obviously, any intermediate value yields an intermediate result between
those two extreme cases.
@param newImageSize New image resolution after rectification. The same size should be passed to
initUndistortRectifyMap (see the stereo_calib.cpp sample in OpenCV samples directory). When (0,0)
is passed (default), it is set to the original imageSize . Setting it to larger value can help you
preserve details in the original image, especially when there is a big radial distortion.
@param validPixROI1 Optional output rectangles inside the rectified images where all the pixels
are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller
(see the picture below).
@param validPixROI2 Optional output rectangles inside the rectified images where all the pixels
are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller
(see the picture below).

The function computes the rotation matrices for each camera that (virtually) make both camera image
planes the same plane. Consequently, this makes all the epipolar lines parallel and thus simplifies
the dense stereo correspondence problem. The function takes the matrices computed by stereoCalibrate
as input. As output, it provides two rotation matrices and also two projection matrices in the new
coordinates. The function distinguishes the following two cases:

-   **Horizontal stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
    mainly along the x axis (with possible small vertical shift). In the rectified images, the
    corresponding epipolar lines in the left and right cameras are horizontal and have the same
    y-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:

    \f[\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix} f & 0 & cx_1 & 0 \\ 0 & f & cy & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\f]

    \f[\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix} f & 0 & cx_2 & T_x*f \\ 0 & f & cy & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} ,\f]

    where \f$T_x\f$ is a horizontal shift between the cameras and \f$cx_1=cx_2\f$ if
    CV_CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set.

-   **Vertical stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
    mainly in vertical direction (and probably a bit in the horizontal direction too). The epipolar
    lines in the rectified images are vertical and have the same x-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:

    \f[\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix} f & 0 & cx & 0 \\ 0 & f & cy_1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\f]

    \f[\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix} f & 0 & cx & 0 \\ 0 & f & cy_2 & T_y*f \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} ,\f]

    where \f$T_y\f$ is a vertical shift between the cameras and \f$cy_1=cy_2\f$ if CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is
    set.

As you can see, the first three columns of P1 and P2 will effectively be the new "rectified" camera
matrices. The matrices, together with R1 and R2 , can then be passed to initUndistortRectifyMap to
initialize the rectification map for each camera.

See below the screenshot from the stereo_calib.cpp sample. Some red horizontal lines pass through
the corresponding image regions. This means that the images are well rectified, which is what most
stereo correspondence algorithms rely on. The green rectangles are roi1 and roi2 . You see that
their interiors are all valid pixels.

rejected prior to computing the homographies. Otherwise,all the points are considered inliers.

The function computes the rectification transformations without knowing intrinsic parameters of the
cameras and their relative position in the space, which explains the suffix "uncalibrated". Another
related difference from stereoRectify is that the function outputs not the rectification
transformations in the object (3D) space, but the planar perspective transformations encoded by the
homography matrices H1 and H2 . The function implements the algorithm @cite Hartley99 .

@note
   While the algorithm does not need to know the intrinsic parameters of the cameras, it heavily
    depends on the epipolar geometry. Therefore, if the camera lenses have a significant distortion,
    it would be better to correct it before computing the fundamental matrix and calling this
    function. For example, distortion coefficients can be estimated for each head of stereo camera
    separately by using calibrateCamera . Then, the images can be corrected using undistort , or
    just the point coordinates can be corrected with undistortPoints .

    @param minDisparity Minimum possible disparity value. Normally, it is zero but sometimes
    rectification algorithms can shift images, so this parameter needs to be adjusted accordingly.
    @param numDisparities Maximum disparity minus minimum disparity. The value is always greater than
    zero. In the current implementation, this parameter must be divisible by 16.
    @param blockSize Matched block size. It must be an odd number \>=1 . Normally, it should be
    somewhere in the 3..11 range.
    @param P1 The first parameter controlling the disparity smoothness. See below.
    @param P2 The second parameter controlling the disparity smoothness. The larger the values are,
    the smoother the disparity is. P1 is the penalty on the disparity change by plus or minus 1
    between neighbor pixels. P2 is the penalty on the disparity change by more than 1 between neighbor
    pixels. The algorithm requires P2 \> P1 . See stereo_match.cpp sample where some reasonably good
    P1 and P2 values are shown (like 8\*number_of_image_channels\*SADWindowSize\*SADWindowSize and
    32\*number_of_image_channels\*SADWindowSize\*SADWindowSize , respectively).

    @param preFilterCap Truncation value for the prefiltered image pixels. The algorithm first
    computes x-derivative at each pixel and clips its value by [-preFilterCap, preFilterCap] interval.
    The result values are passed to the Birchfield-Tomasi pixel cost function.
    @param uniquenessRatio Margin in percentage by which the best (minimum) computed cost function
    value should "win" the second best value to consider the found match correct. Normally, a value
    within the 5-15 range is good enough.
    @param speckleWindowSize Maximum size of smooth disparity regions to consider their noise speckles
    and invalidate. Set it to 0 to disable speckle filtering. Otherwise, set it somewhere in the
    50-200 range.
    @param speckleRange Maximum disparity variation within each connected component. If you do speckle
    filtering, set the parameter to a positive value, it will be implicitly multiplied by 16.
    Normally, 1 or 2 is good enough.
    @param mode Set it to StereoSGBM::MODE_HH to run the full-scale two-pass dynamic programming
