/** @brief Loads an image from a file.

@anchor imread

The function imread loads an image from the specified file and returns it. If the image cannot be
read (because of missing file, improper permissions, unsupported or invalid format), the function
returns an empty matrix ( Mat::data==NULL ).

Currently, the following file formats are supported:

-   Windows bitmaps - \*.bmp, \*.dib (always supported)
-   JPEG files - \*.jpeg, \*.jpg, \*.jpe (see the *Notes* section)
-   JPEG 2000 files - \*.jp2 (see the *Notes* section)
-   Portable Network Graphics - \*.png (see the *Notes* section)
-   WebP - \*.webp (see the *Notes* section)
-   Portable image format - \*.pbm, \*.pgm, \*.ppm \*.pxm, \*.pnm (always supported)
-   Sun rasters - \*.sr, \*.ras (always supported)
-   TIFF files - \*.tiff, \*.tif (see the *Notes* section)
-   OpenEXR Image files - \*.exr (see the *Notes* section)
-   Radiance HDR - \*.hdr, \*.pic (always supported)
-   Raster and Vector geospatial data supported by Gdal (see the *Notes* section)

@note

-   The function determines the type of an image by the content, not by the file extension.
-   In the case of color images, the decoded images will have the channels stored in **B G R** order.
-   On Microsoft Windows\* OS and MacOSX\*, the codecs shipped with an OpenCV image (libjpeg,
    libpng, libtiff, and libjasper) are used by default. So, OpenCV can always read JPEGs, PNGs,
    and TIFFs. On MacOSX, there is also an option to use native MacOSX image readers. But beware
    that currently these native image loaders give images with different pixel values because of
    the color management embedded into MacOSX.
-   On Linux\*, BSD flavors and other Unix-like open-source operating systems, OpenCV looks for
    codecs supplied with an OS image. Install the relevant packages (do not forget the development
    files, for example, "libjpeg-dev", in Debian\* and Ubuntu\*) to get the codec support or turn
    on the OPENCV_BUILD_3RDPARTY_LIBS flag in CMake.
-   In the case you set *WITH_GDAL* flag to true in CMake and @ref IMREAD_LOAD_GDAL to load the image,
    then [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) driver will be used in order to decode the image by supporting
    the following formats: [Raster](http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html),
    [Vector](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html).

/** @brief Saves an image to a specified file.

The function imwrite saves the image to the specified file. The image format is chosen based on the
filename extension (see cv::imread for the list of extensions). Only 8-bit (or 16-bit unsigned (CV_16U)
in case of PNG, JPEG 2000, and TIFF) single-channel or 3-channel (with 'BGR' channel order) images
can be saved using this function. If the format, depth or channel order is different, use
Mat::convertTo , and cv::cvtColor to convert it before saving. Or, use the universal FileStorage I/O
functions to save the image to XML or YAML format.

It is possible to store PNG images with an alpha channel using this function. To do this, create
8-bit (or 16-bit) 4-channel image BGRA, where the alpha channel goes last. Fully transparent pixels
should have alpha set to 0, fully opaque pixels should have alpha set to 255/65535.

The sample below shows how to create such a BGRA image and store to PNG file. It also demonstrates how to set custom
compression parameters :
@code
    #include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

    using namespace cv;
    using namespace std;

    void createAlphaMat(Mat &mat)
    {
        CV_Assert(mat.channels() == 4);
        for (int i = 0; i < mat.rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < mat.cols; ++j) {
                Vec4b& bgra = mat.at<Vec4b>(i, j);
                bgra[0] = UCHAR_MAX; // Blue
                bgra[1] = saturate_cast<uchar>((float (mat.cols - j)) / ((float)mat.cols) * UCHAR_MAX); // Green
                bgra[2] = saturate_cast<uchar>((float (mat.rows - i)) / ((float)mat.rows) * UCHAR_MAX); // Red
                bgra[3] = saturate_cast<uchar>(0.5 * (bgra[1] + bgra[2])); // Alpha
            }
        }
    }

    int main(int argv, char **argc)
    {
        // Create mat with alpha channel
        Mat mat(480, 640, CV_8UC4);
        createAlphaMat(mat);

        vector<int> compression_params;
        compression_params.push_back(IMWRITE_PNG_COMPRESSION);
        compression_params.push_back(9);

        try {
            imwrite("alpha.png", mat, compression_params);
        }
        catch (cv::Exception& ex) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Exception converting image to PNG format: %s\n", ex.what());
            return 1;
        }

        fprintf(stdout, "Saved PNG file with alpha data.\n");
        return 0;
    }
