  @defgroup videostab Video Stabilization

The video stabilization module contains a set of functions and classes that can be used to solve the
problem of video stabilization. There are a few methods implemented, most of them are descibed in
the papers @cite OF06 and @cite G11 . However, there are some extensions and deviations from the orginal
paper methods.

         @defgroup videostab_motion Global Motion Estimation

The video stabilization module contains a set of functions and classes for global motion estimation
between point clouds or between images. In the last case features are extracted and matched
internally. For the sake of convenience the motion estimation functions are wrapped into classes.
Both the functions and the classes are available.

         @defgroup videostab_marching Fast Marching Method

The Fast Marching Method @cite Telea04 is used in of the video stabilization routines to do motion and
color inpainting. The method is implemented is a flexible way and it's made public for other users.
