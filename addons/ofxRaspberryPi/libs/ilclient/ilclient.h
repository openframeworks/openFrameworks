 * \brief This API defines helper functions for writing IL clients.
 *
 * This file defines an IL client side library.  This is useful when
 * writing IL clients, since there tends to be much repeated and
 * common code across both single and multiple clients.  This library
 * seeks to remove that common code and abstract some of the
 * interactions with components.  There is a wrapper around a
 * component and tunnel, and some operations can be done on lists of
 * these.  The callbacks from components are handled, and specific
 * events can be checked or waited for.
