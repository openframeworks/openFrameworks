USING ofxJSON
============================================

1) add all of the files in ofxJSON/src and ofxJSON/lib/src to your project
2) add ofxJSON/lib/lib/[your platform]/libcurl.a to your project
3) add "../../../addons/ofxJSON/lib/include" to your Header Search Paths
	note: this assumes that you are using the typical layout, where your project
	is in [openFrameworks dir]/apps/*/myProject 
	and the ofxJSON addon is in [openFrameworks dir]/addons


RUNNING THE EXAMPLE
============================================

1) Move ofxJSONExamples to [openFrameworks dir]/apps
2) if you are not using OSX, add all of the files in ofxJSONExample/src to a project and follow the steps in "USING ofxJSON"
