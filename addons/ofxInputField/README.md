# ofxInputField

Text and number input field for openFrameworks extending ofxGui. So in contrast to ofxTextInputField it works out of the box with ofxGui (but also only there). 

ofxInputField can be used as an alternative to ofxSlider to define numbers more precicly or to ofxLabel to have editable labels. The mouse and keyboard controls are elaborated in detail. Check out the example with an int, float and string version ofxInputField.
