   - glTexCoord is now setTexCoord
   - glBegin / glEnd are now begin / end

- with safeMode on (default):
   - array is automatically reallocated when space runs out
   - all client states are enabled and disabled as nessecary
- with safeMode off (for advanced users) you can get much better performance if you know what to do, see docs.
