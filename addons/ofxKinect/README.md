Description
-----------

ofxKinect is an Open Frameworks addon for the Xbox Kinect that runs on Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows.
OpenFrameworks is a cross platform open source toolkit for creative coding in C++.

[http://www.openframeworks.cc/](http://www.openframeworks.cc/)

#### NOTE: Xbox Kinect models > 1414 (1473, etc) or Kinect4Windows devices that have been plugged into an XBox will not work with ofxKinect on  Mac OSX

If you have an Xbox Kinect model 1473+ or Kinect4Windows device and want to use it with ofxKinect on OSX, DO NOT plug it into an XBox! If you do, it will receive a firmware update which will cause it to freeze after about 20 secs with libfreenect/ofxKinect on OSX. Linux and Windows are fine. The [fix is in the works](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/pull/325).

In the meantime, we suggest you get the *original* Xbox Kinect model 1414 and keep those new toys away from an XBox ...


Running the Example Project
---------------------------

An example project is provided in the `examples/addons/kinectExample` in your OpenFrameworks distribution. If you've downloaded/cloned OF from Github, use the OpenFrameworks ProjectGenerator in `apps/projectGenerator` to generate the Xcode, VS2012, CodeBlocks projects and/or Makefiles by pointing it to the `kinectExample` folder and making sure to include the following addons:

* ofxKinect (duh)
* ofxOpenCv (for blob tracking in the example, not required by ofxKinect itself.)

### OSX

Open the Xcode project, select the "kinectExample Debug" scheme, and hit "Run".

### Linux

Install the libusb-1.0 library. On Ubuntu, you can do this with:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
</pre>

Note: as of OF 0.8.2 ofxKinect requires libusb 1.0.12 or newer. 
This can be installed by updating or re-installing the libusb-1.0-0-dev package.  

Open the Code::Blocks .cbp and hit F9 to build. Optionally, you can build the example with the Makefile.

To run it, use the terminal:
<pre>
make
cd bin
./example_debug
</pre>

Also, you can add a set of udev rules which allow you to run a Kinect app without root privileges:
<pre>
   sudo cp libs/libfreenect/platform/linux/udev/51-kinect.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
</pre>

### Windows

Precompiled libusb libs are included for Windows.

Install instructions: 

The easiest way to add the correct usb drivers to a Kinect device is to use the Free USB Driver tool: http://zadig.akeo.ie/
Select your Xbox Camera, Xbox Audio and Xbox Motor in the drop down and then select the libusbk driver from the driver menu and click install. ( you will need to do this three times, once for the camera, then motor, then audio ).  This advice comes from the https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect#windows ReadMe. 

ofxKinect will not work if the drivers are not installed.

**NOTE**: You cannot use the OpenNI drivers and the libfreenect drivers included with ofxKinect at the same time. You must manually uninstall one and reinstall the other in the Device Manager. Sorry, that's just how it is. :P 

	
#### Windows (Msys2):

Install libusb using

    pacman --needed -Sy mingw-w64-i686-libusb

	

How to Create a New ofxKinect Project
-------------------------------------

As of OF 0.8.0, you can also create a new ofxKinect project using the ProjectGenerator, found in `openFrameworks/apps/projectGenerator`.

Adding ofxKinect to an Existing Project
---------------------------------------

**As of OF 0.8.0, you can use the OF ProjectGenerator to create ofxKinect projects**

Notes
-----

### Using multiple Kinects

ofxKinect supports multiple Kinects, however stability is based on the bandwidth of your usb hardware. If you only require the depth image, it is recommended to disable the video grabbing of the rgb/ir images from your devices:
<pre>
kinect.init(false, false);  // disable video image (faster fps)
</pre>

For Kinect4Windows, Microsoft states that only 2 Kinects can be supported on the same USB bus. In practice on OSX, this proves to be the case as, even with the RGB images disabled, there are transfer errors using ofxKinect and 3 Kinects simultaneously. If you need to support many Kinects, you will probably need to add extra USB controllers to your machine â€¦
