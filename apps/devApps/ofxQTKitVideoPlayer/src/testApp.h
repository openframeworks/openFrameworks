 * 
 * ofxQTKitVideoPlayer provides QTKit/CoreVideo accelerated movie playback
 * for openFrameworks on OS X
 * 
 * This class replaces almost all of the functionality of ofVideoPlayer on OS X
 * and uses the modern QTKit and CoreVideo libraries for playback
 *
 * Special Thanks to Marek Bereza for his initial QTKitVideoTexture

 *
 * Thanks to Anton Marini for help wrangling buffer contexts
